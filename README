To run the simulation, run the main method of TrainSim.java.

All modifications to the system must be performed manually.
The following variables can be modified:
  The number of Trains
  The number of TrainCars per Train
  The number of TrainEvents
  
To ensure that the simulation runs properly:
  The number of TrainEvents must be the same as the number of Trains
  Each TrainEvent must be added to the agenda
  Each Train must have the same number of TrainCars.
